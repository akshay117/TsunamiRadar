## TsunamiRadar

This repository contains data from seismic sensors located across various regions in India. The data is collected and updated every 20 minutes to provide live insights into seismic activities.The json can be taken from `headlines.json`. 

## Data Description

The data includes the following fields for each station:

Station Code: Unique identifier for the station.
Station Name: Name or location of the station.
Latitude: Latitude coordinate of the station.
Longitude: Longitude coordinate of the station.
Sampling Rate: The rate at which the sensor samples data, in Hz.
Sensor Name: Type of seismic sensor used.
Digitizer: Type of digitizer used to convert analog signals to digital.
Organization: Organization managing the station.
Health: Current health status of the station (e.g., Healthy)

## Sensor Details

All stations in India are equipped with the following sensors and digitizers:

Sensor: Trillium240
Digitizer: Taurus

## Future Scope

### Early Alerts: By analyzing the seismic data in real-time, we can develop systems to provide early warnings for earthquakes and other seismic events. This can help in minimizing damage and saving lives by giving people more time to take necessary precautions.

### Detailed Analysis: The continuous data stream allows for in-depth analysis of seismic activities. Researchers can study patterns, identify potential fault lines, and understand the behavior of seismic waves in different regions.

### Infrastructure Planning: The insights gained from seismic data can aid in planning and constructing buildings and infrastructure that are more resilient to seismic activities, thereby reducing the risk of damage.

### Educational Purposes: The data can be used for educational purposes, helping students and researchers understand the dynamics of seismic activities and the importance of earthquake preparedness.
